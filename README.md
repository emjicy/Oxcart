# What is Oxcart?

Oxcart is an efficient vote-accounting methodology for legitimizing group-decisions, using cascading vote-capital accounting for a closed-system of agents fully delegated within that system, inspired by liquid democracy, and allowing for individual agents to change their delegations and choices at any time.

This repository aims to aggregate methodologies that exhibit Oxcart features, providing an open-source platform for experimentation and development of this voting system.

## How it works

Oxcart works by allowing participants to delegate their vote-capital to trusted agents who can then delegate it further down the chain. The idea is that participants delegate their vote to people they trust and respect, rather than just to a political party or ideology. This creates a more dynamic and fluid system of voting where participants can change their choices and representatives at any time once an initiative or election is under consideration.

Oxcart also uses a vote-capital system, which means that each participant has a certain amount of vote-capital to delegate. This ensures that accurate global democratic legitimacy accounting is human-readable between various peer-groups.

## Getting Started

To get started with Oxcart, you can attend the Oxcart Applied Research [bi-weekly community call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MmkyMnZuMHVjbG9obnExN3Jwb2pmbG40c2RfMjAyMzA1MTZUMTUwMDAwWiBjX2Y2NTcxNDc1YjQ2ZWRiYjE0MzczYWU5OTVhNGIwYzAwMDg3MTA0OTgzMmM0OTkyYTExZDFlOTk2MmJjMGIwZGZAZw&tmsrc=c_f6571475b46edbb14373ae995a4b0c000871049832c4992a11d1e9962bc0b0df%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL) to find out if your passions align with those currently working openly on the challenges of the day. The [Oxcart Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_f6571475b46edbb14373ae995a4b0c000871049832c4992a11d1e9962bc0b0df%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) includes Department-level meetings and workshops that may be of interest. The Oxcart Telegram channel can be found [here](https://t.me/+rYEX-fO8TmcxZDMx), be sure to introduce yourself when you drop-in. Feel free to experiment and modify on your own as well and share results in this repository by making a pull-request.
